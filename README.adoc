A tool for verifying links in AsciiDoc files written in Go.

== Motivation

Ambitious tech writers use AsciiDoc for turning text into properly formatted blog posts, web pages and documentation.
Incorporating URLs to refer to external resources is part of the process. Before publishing content it's important if
the linked URLs are valid and can be resolved. Nothing feels more unprofessional than broken links in a carefully crafted
document.

AsciiDoc link verifier to the rescue! Automatically discover all AsciiDoc files in a given directory and verify all links
found in the documents before publishing them.

== Command line options

- `sourceDir`: The source directory used to search for AsciiDoc files. Defaults to the directory `content`.
- `fail`: Fails the program if at least one discovered link cannot be resolved. Default to `true`.
